# Bigup Contact Form

This plugin is no longer being developed as it was forked to concentrate on Gutenberg expansion. Please see: [https://github.com/bigupjeff/bigup-forms](https://github.com/bigupjeff/bigup-forms).


This plugin provides a static pre-configured contact form with name, email and message inputs. It's powered by PHPMailer and includes a robust validation and error feedback system. It also allows for the colleciton of submitted forms as a custom post type, so messages are readable from within WP admin. It includes shortcode and widget support for classic themes.
